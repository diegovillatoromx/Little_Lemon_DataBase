## Have you created a GitHub repository to house your code?

Yes, I have created a repository on GitHub, which serves not only to host the code but also to facilitate collaboration. I am open to contributions and suggestions, and you can find all the necessary information to contribute in the README file. Here is the link to the [repository](https://github.com/diegovillatoromx/Little_Lemon_DataBase/tree/main).
